    "For example, the `Cholera_Deaths.shp` shapefile [contains](https://github.com/jamesdamillington/john-snow/blob/main/README.md) the number of deaths due to Cholera reported at locations around Soho during the [1854 cholera outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak). How can we compare the number of deaths reported by this datafile to the buffers and Thiessen polygons (voronoi) created in those other notebooks?\n",

    "## Essentials of Spatial Joins  <a id='notes'></a>\n",
    "Spatial Joins rely on concepts from both [Spatial relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_relation) and [non-spatial joining of DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/merging.html).   \n",
    "\n",
    "When doing a spatial join, we need to decide two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- what spatial relation are we going to use to do the join? (defined by the `op` argument)\n",
    "- which type of join between the two DataFrames? (defined by the `how` argument)\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible spatial relations we can use [with `sjoin` in GeoPandas are](https://geopandas.org/mergingdata.html#spatial-joins):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `intersects`: The attributes will be joined if the boundary and interior of the object intersect in any way with the boundary and/or interior of the other object.\n",
    "- `within`: The attributes will be joined if the object’s boundary and interior intersect only with the interior of the other object (not its boundary or exterior).\n",
    "- `contains`: The attributes will be joined if the object’s interior contains the boundary and interior of the other object and their boundaries do not touch at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "These relations are identical to those with the same [Shapely function](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html#binary-predicates) name (indeed, GeoPandas uses those exact functions itself). See the [Spatial Relations notebook](https://github.com/jamesdamillington/john-snow/blob/main/code/python/Relations.ipynb) for more on these. \n",
    "\n",
    "Possible types of join [are](https://geopandas.org/mergingdata.html#spatial-joins):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `left`: use the index from the first (or left_df) geodataframe that you provide to sjoin; retain only the left_df geometry column\n",
    "- `right`: use index from second (or right_df); retain only the right_df geometry column\n",
    "- `inner`: use intersection of index values from both geodataframes; retain only the left_df geometry column\n",
    "\n",
    "These determine which geometry is retained (i.e. from which DataFrame), and are the same as those used in [Pandas merge methods](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/merging.html#brief-primer-on-merge-methods-relational-algebra). "
