# john-snow
Spatial analysis playground using data related to "John Snow's cholera epidemic"

## data
Data are from several sources:
- `data/csds` contains data prepared by [Center for Spatial Data Science](https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab//snow/).
- `data/dani` contains data prepared by [Dani Arribas-Bel](https://bitbucket.org/darribas/reproducible_john_snow/src/master/)

Both of the data sets above are based in some way on data prepared by [Robin Wilson](http://blog.rtwilson.com/john-snows-cholera-data-in-more-formats/)

## code

[Arribas-Bel_etal_2017.ipynb](/code/python/Arribas-Bel_etal_2017.ipynb) re-implements code from [Arribas-Bel _et al._ (2017)](http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50590-9_17) for more recent versions of packages
